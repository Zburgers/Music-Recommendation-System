## 🌟 About the Project

The **Music Recommendation System** uses data-driven approaches like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid techniques to suggest music tracks to users. It analyzes user interactions and music metadata to generate accurate and scalable recommendations.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Personalized Recommendations** — Tailored music suggestions based on user behavior.
- 📊 **Data Insights** — Analyze music trends and user patterns.
- ⚙️ **Flexible Algorithms** — Easily switch between recommendation techniques.
- 🚀 **Scalable Pipeline** — Designed to handle large-scale datasets efficiently.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** — Core development language
- **Jupyter Notebook** — For interactive analysis and model experimentation
- **Pandas, NumPy** — Data handling and manipulation
- **Scikit-learn, TensorFlow** — ML models and evaluation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** — Data visualization

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git

### 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zburgers/Music-Recommendation-System.git
   cd Music-Recommendation-System
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 📖 Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the notebooks under the `notebooks/` directory to:
   - Preprocess the dataset
   - Train various models
   - Evaluate recommendation performance

3. Use the trained models from the `models/` directory to generate music recommendations.
