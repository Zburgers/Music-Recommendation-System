## 🌟 About the Project

The **Music Recommendation System** is a machine learning-based application that predicts and suggests music tracks to users based on their listening history, preferences, and trends in the dataset. By leveraging collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches, the system aims to provide personalized recommendations.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Recommends music tailored to user preferences.
- **Data Analysis**: Insights into music trends and user behavior.
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets efficiently.
- **Customizable Algorithms**: Plug-and-play support for different recommendation algorithms.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for backend development.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn & TensorFlow**: Machine learning algorithms and models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
